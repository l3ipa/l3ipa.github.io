> The workshop on Life-Long Learning in Practical Applications is organized during the [World Congress On Computational Intelligence](https://wcci2022.org/) in Padua, Italy.

# About

Despite the proliferation on advanced machine learning and AI methods applied to plethora of applications, those approaches still suffer from problems and challenges such as: difficulties to adaptability to ever-changing data and data streams, the need for continuous improvement of the (once-established) models, missing and incomplete and unreliable data and datasets, the need to include human operator feedback in the loop, etc.

In this session we’d like to focus on practical applications of those new proposals and approaches to counter abovementioned problems such as e.g. life-long learning, online learning, transfer learning, active learning and other similar concepts.

We’d like to invite papers and projects focusing on those new approaches to machine learning in applied to practical problems such as: cybersecurity, anomaly detection, fake news detection, medical images analysis among others.

Therefore in this session, we would like to bring together researchers from ML and AI communities from various application areas who are working on practical implementations and deployment of new paradigms in machine learning, and on life-long learning systems and methods in particular.

  <h5>High Performance Data Mining on GPUs, Hadoop, Spark, and beyond</h5>
  The ever-increasing dimensionality of data poses the main challenge to the scalability of data mining algorithms to run in reasonable time. Parallel and distributed architectures, particularly based on GPUs and the MapReduce model on Apache Hadoop or Spark, have become popular approaches to alleviate the prohibitive runtimes of machine learning algorithms on big data. Not only does the size of data increases the computational complexity but also the emergence of new data-level difficulties and calls for novel learning paradigms. Learning from imbalanced, high-dimensional, data streams with concept drift, or multi-label, to name a few, increase the complexity of algorithms to model such massive data accurately. Therefore, there is a need of new approaches to keep up with the increasing complexity and size of learning from difficult data. This talk reviews advances on the scalability of data mining in recent years and discusses the open issues and future lines of research.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

Colons can be used to align columns.


The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
